# DishListüßë‚Äçüç≥
I had the brainchild behind this application after months of sitting at my desk going through my recipe Pinterest board, various cookbooks laying around the house, and recalling recipes from memory to create a weekly grocery list. The more recipes that become part of my fiance and I's monthly rotation, the more pages I need to reference in order before I can go to the grocery store. I thought to myself, what if this was saved all in one place, where I can just say what I want to cook, and my grocery list will be made for me. Hence the GroceryListMaker! To build the initial release for this project, I wanted to:

- Create a user interface to display all of my recipes and remind me of some of those yummy ones that I might have forgotten about.
- Quickly be able to add and remove recipes that I find online or might feel dont fit into our life style anymore.
- Compile an exportable list of ingredients and quantities needed to create the selected recipes for the week.

## How It's Made:
**Tech stack:** Node.js, Express, React, Postgres

My initial idea for the application was first drawn up in Figma. My Minimum Viable Project consisted of:
* Basic CRUD operation
  * Create a recipe
  * Read back recipes
  * Update recipes
  * Delete recipes
* When a recipe is selected, the ingredients consolidate into a list

## Lessons Learned:

This project was actually my first attempt at a full stack project, so there were quite a few lessons learned that I think have expanded my knowledge on Node.js, interacting between back and front end, and designing my database to work for the end application.
