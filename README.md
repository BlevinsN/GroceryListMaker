#ðŸŒŸ My Awesome Project
I had the brainchild behind this application after months of sitting at my desk going through my recipe Pinterest board, various cookbooks laying around the house, and recalling recipes from memory to create a weekly grocery list. The more recipes that become part of my fiance and I's monthly rotation, the more pages I need to reference in order before I can go to the grocery store. I thought to myself, what if this was saved all in one place, where I can just say what I want to cook, and my grocery list will be made for me. Hence the GroceryListMaker! To build the initial release for this project, I wanted to:

Create a user interface to display all of my recipes and remind me of some of those yummy ones that I might have forgotten about.
Quickly be able to add and remove recipes that I find online or might feel dont fit into our life style anymore.
Compile an exportable list of ingredients and quantities needed to create the selected recipes for the week.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
